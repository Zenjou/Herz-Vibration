# Description:
This project focuses on designing a PCB for real-time seismocardiograms utilizing geophones. Geophones efficiently capture vibrations produced by cardiac activity (Seismocardiography) . The custom-designed PCB seamlessly integrates with existing software, enabling efficient signal processing and in-depth analysis. Eagle PCB schematics, manufacturing files (including Gerber files and drill files), and a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM) are provided for straightforward replication.

# Features:
Custom-designed PCB optimized for seamless integration with geophones.

Eagle PCB schematics for a thorough understanding and easy modification.

Inclusion of all essential manufacturing files, including Gerber files and drill files, for PCB fabrication.

Utilizes the STM32 NUCLEO-L452 development board for enhanced functionality.

# Technologies Used:
Eagle PCB for schematic design.

Geophonic sensors for vibration capture (3 Geophones for each axis).

STM32 NUCLEO-L452 development board.

**SerialPlot by Hasan Yavuz Özderya for graphical visualization.**

ADS131M03 3-channel, 24-bit, 64 kSPS simultaneous sampling delta-sigma ADC.
